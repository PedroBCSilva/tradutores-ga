# Lexical Analyser 
### Setting up your environment
This project uses the tool [Flex](https://github.com/westes/flex) which is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognize lexical patterns in text. 
* For Mac user
    * `brew install flex` 

Also I've found this Visual Code Extension that can be pretty helpful [Lex Flex Yacc Bison](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=faustinoaq.lex-flex-yacc-bison)
